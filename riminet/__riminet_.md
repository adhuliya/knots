The Rules
------------------

1. Two things are most likely related if they occur at the same time.
2. Two things are related in sequence if they occur one after the other.
3. Two things are similar if many of their attributes/sub-attributes match.
4. Imagining is a projection of mind on the senses of the body.
   (Notice when one is imagining something visual the current visual input
   is lost. That is why we probably see above/close our eyes when imagining so that
   our visuals are not distracted by the active environment around us. This
   is more or less applicable to all our senses. We find it difficult to 
   recall a tune when listening to some other music. We are reusing
   the same part of the brain. This hints that machines can also imagine.)
5. A brain is like a customized mirror. It tries to reflect its environment
   by replicating it internally. This internal replication is bound
   by the physical nature of the brain and its current state.
6. More related two things are, closer/stronger are their representations
   in the brain.
7. The "what" and "how much" pretty much consumes the perception that the
   brain exhibits. Using the analogy of waves, "what" constitutes
   the frequency and "how much" constitutes the amplitute.
8. The internal state of the brain and the body is also an input to the
   brain. That enables the brain to perceive itself, and to think
   and reason about itself.
9. A rogue fact should wither away.
10. Present has the same weightage as the past. (parameterize)
11. A good guess by a fact cell should be rewarded. A bad guess
    should be penalized.
12. Every cell has an activation decay that roughly tells when
    was it last active.

Misc Notes
-------------------
1. The name of the first avatar with RIMINET could be, `Ajju`.
   Ajju means `mother` in Sanskrit.
   It is the name my wife gave to a big monkey soft-toy I gifted her
   before marriage. The name is simple and with appropriate meaning.
   More about the name could be found [here](https://www.moonastro.com/babyname/baby%20name%20ajju%20meaning.aspx).
