## Profiling Memory Usage
0. Very basic: `sys.getsizeof()`
1. Good solution that is great: <https://goshippo.com/blog/measure-real-size-any-python-object/>.
   I have added this to the `common_util.py` file as `getSize()` function.
2. Second best solution: <https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/>
and <http://fa.bianp.net/blog/2014/plot-memory-usage-as-a-function-of-time/>
