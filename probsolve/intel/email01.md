Dear Professor Sunita Sarawagi

How are you doing?I am writing on behalf of the Processor Architecture 
Research (PAR) Lab at Intel Labs based out of Bangalore, India.

PAR Lab is hiring full-time Research Scientists and we are also offering 
Research Internships and 3-year Research Fellowships in the following 
topics:

1) CPU Architecture and microarchitecture research

2) co-design across System Software (OS, runtimes, compilers) and CPU 
and Memory (hardware) architecture to enable efficient next-generation 
datacenter cloud services

3) cross-stack co-optimized Software+Hardware for next-generation 
Artificial Intelligence applications

Could you please forward these requirements to your student lists?

Interested students can send resume and covering letter to

We much appreciate your help.

Thanks and regards,
