### How I filed tax in 2018?
I downloaded the officially provided ITR1 java based application on windows 10 (it didn't run on Ubuntu) and filled the ITR1 form, and exported it in an xml format. Form 16 had many details that helped fill the form accurately. I then uploaded the xml to the ITR website through the HDFC netbanking gateway (Request -> Income Tax E-Filing). I had verified the bank account through the [itr website](https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home) first. To make the form filling process easier, I downloaded a prefilled xml file from the itr website and loaded it into the application.

Notes
-------------
* For salaried individuals ITR1 form is applicable for salaried individuals with total income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, and other sources such as interest income, etc. 
* Tax calculated through the ITR form, should tally with the Form 26AS. This is a form that shows how much tax you have paid for the Financial Year till date. If it doesn't, then after filling the form, make the payment ASAP.
* Form 16
