$ django-admin startproject mysite

$ python manage.py runserver 0:8000

Let’s look at what startproject created:

mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py



$ python manage.py runserver

$ python manage.py startapp polls

That’ll create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:

polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py



$ python manage.py makemigrations polls

$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001

If you’re interested, you can also run python manage.py check; this checks for any problems in your project without making migrations or touching the database.

$ python manage.py migrate

We can examine the machine instructions emitted in this step by calling llc with the -print-machineinstrs flag and looking at the first output that says "After instruction selection":

By passing -show-mc-inst and -show-mc-encoding to llc, we can see the MC-level instructions it creates with their encoding, alongside the actual assembly code:

/// This is the main entry point for the type legalizer. This does a top-down
/// traversal of the dag, legalizing types as it goes. Returns "true" if it made
/// any changes.
bool DAGTypeLegalizer::run() {
  bool Changed = false;


 The various operation node types are described at the top of the include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h file.

 Because nodes may define multiple values, edges are represented by instances of the SDValue class, which is a <SDNode, unsigned> pair, indicating the node and result value being used, respectively. Each value produced by an SDNode has an associated MVT (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is.
