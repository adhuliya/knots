$ django-admin startproject mysite

$ python manage.py runserver 0:8000

Let’s look at what startproject created:

mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py



$ python manage.py runserver

$ python manage.py startapp polls

That’ll create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:

polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py



$ python manage.py makemigrations polls

$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001

If you’re interested, you can also run python manage.py check; this checks for any problems in your project without making migrations or touching the database.

$ python manage.py migrate

We can examine the machine instructions emitted in this step by calling llc with the -print-machineinstrs flag and looking at the first output that says "After instruction selection":

By passing -show-mc-inst and -show-mc-encoding to llc, we can see the MC-level instructions it creates with their encoding, alongside the actual assembly code:

/// This is the main entry point for the type legalizer. This does a top-down
/// traversal of the dag, legalizing types as it goes. Returns "true" if it made
/// any changes.
bool DAGTypeLegalizer::run() {
  bool Changed = false;


 The various operation node types are described at the top of the include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h file.

 Because nodes may define multiple values, edges are represented by instances of the SDValue class, which is a <SDNode, unsigned> pair, indicating the node and result value being used, respectively. Each value produced by an SDNode has an associated MVT (Machine Value Type) indicating what the type of the value is.

Once upon a time in a jungle, deers lived a care free life.
One day, a pride of lions ventured into the jungle, to everyone's surprise.

All deers hid to starve the lions to death!
But some deers had not seen the pride and they were laughing at the rest.
They enticed other deers with fresh field grass where the danger most lied,
only to be eaten by the lions once in a while...

The lions survived on the ignorants...
And careful deers were frustated by their predicaments.
The deers began to miss the nourishing grass on the fields,
and all the fun they had when the nature was their shield.

The wait seems too long... the lions survived...
The deers lived, but their fresh grass livelihoods died
The grass in the hidden corners of the jungle was running out fast...
The deers had no choice left at last...

The lions didn't die, but the deers stepped out...
They had watched the hunting of the ignorants,
and some accidents of the passed outs.
Lessons learned...
The deers ate on large grasslands,
where the lions had no choice but to be clearly seen on the plain lands.
The deers ran when lions came,
but some slipped and died lame...

Now the lions were a part of life,
and the deers survived,
and the deers survived.


# Related Work notes:
From Lerner's paper:
A number of analysis frameworks have been developed for
making intra- and inter-procedural analyses easier to write
and reason about, includeing Sharlit[27], SPARE [28],
FIAT [17], McCAT [19], System-Z [34], PAG[2], the k-tuple
dataflow analysis framework [23], and Dwyer and Clarke's
system [15]. However, none of these systems address integrating
transformations with analyses, nor automatically
combining analyses profitably.

Manual methods:

Nelson and Oppen [24] - describe how under certain conditions
  satisfiability programs for several theories can be combined into
  a satisfiability program for the combined theory.
Click and Cooper [9] - defines formally the circumstances in which two
  dataflow analyses should be integrated to reach better fixed points than
  repeated sequences of the two analyses run separately.
Cousot and Cousot[11] - also point out that such interactions can arise.

Whitfield and Soffa [32, 33] - examins interactions between different optimizations.

Assmann [3,4]


Bronevetsky and Anantkrishnan:

Loose composition - e.g. LLVM
Tight composition - e.g. Wegman.., Click.., Lerner.., Nelson..

If you know the commit you want to return to is the head of some branch, or is tagged, then you can just

git checkout branchname

You can also use git reflog to see what other commits your HEAD (or any other ref) has pointed to in the past.
git log --all (or more usefully, git log --oneline --graph --all).
